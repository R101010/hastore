## **Overview**

A Cup of Sugar, like it's name implies is a streamlined, easy to use Python base website, it brings  together people who need a helping hand and those looking to give one. A helping hand might mean something small to you but it could mean the world to someone else.

When the Ternary Operators were formed, they had one goal in mind. To create something that could make someone's life a little better. In a moment of inspiration, Danny, one of the founding members of the Ternary Operators thought of a way to bring people together that are in need with those willing to lend a hand. With this vision in mind the Ternary Operators set out to make this moment a reality.
